# Virtual-Stock-Trading-System

-A GoLang application that enables a user to enter the Yahoo! stock codes he wants to purchase and also allocate a percentage of his budget for each of his stocks.

-User receives a transaction ID and can view how much of his budget was allocated to the stocks.

-A user can use this ID later and also view how much profit or loss is recorded for the current price of the stock.

-Implemented JSON-RPC over HTTP client/server for building a virtual stock trading system in GoLang.
